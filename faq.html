                                            campaign?</h3>
                                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The first thing you want to do is target your audience,
                                            i.e. whom do you want to mail to? What does your ideal customer look like?
                                            What are the demographics that define your ideal customer base? Deciding
                                            whom you want to mail to usually determines how many pieces of direct mail
                                            you will send out. It also determines what kind of mail piece you will
                                            create, i.e. postcard, brochure, enveloped letter, etc….</p>
                                        <h3>Q: What is the minimum number of pieces required to do a bulk mailing?</h3>
                                        <p><strong>A:</strong>No. As long as you are sending out mail at the Presorted
                                            Standard or Presorted First Class postage rates, you can just use our
                                            mailing permits. The only condition to using Better Letter’s mailing permit,
                                            is that Better Letter has to be the organization that prepares and processes
                                            your mail. Also, only an agent of Better Letter can present bulk-mail at the
                                            post office that has a Better Letter mailing permit indicia printed on it.

                                        <h3>Q: How do I take advantage of maximum postage discounts?</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>A:</strong>
                                            Many people have the misconception that postage discounts are based on the
                                            volume of mail sent out at one time. This is inaccurate. Postage discounts
                                            are not volume based, but are based the how well the mail is pre-sorted and
                                            pre-barcoded. Every bulk mailing is inspected and verified by the post
                                            office upon entry into the mail stream. That is when the Post Office
                                            determines if you qualify for the discounted postage rates or not. In other
                                            words, postage discounts are determined by how your mailing list sorts out,
                                            based on postal regulations. Once we have your mailing list, the first thing
                                            we do is take out all of the duplicated addresses (there is no need to send
                                            duplicate mailings to the same address). Then we Move Update your mailing
                                            list to make sure that the person you are targeting is still at that
                                            address. Finally, we Zip+4/CASS certify your mailing list, which verifies
                                            the delivery address and assigns the nine-digit zipcode. Once we have all of
                                            your mailing list information updated, then we pre-sort and pre-barcode your
                                            mailing according to USPS regulations. That way your direct mail piece is
                                            ready to travel straight to the USPS barcode sorting machines. Presenting
                                            mail that is already pre-sorted and pre-barcoded means there is less work
                                            for the Post Office to do to process your mailing. In return, they give you
                                            reduced postage rates when we present your mail for processing.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Q: Are there any design guidelines to consider when preparing a mass
                                            mailing?</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>A:</strong>
                                            Yes!! The United States Post Office has very specific rules and regulations
                                            that govern the processing of direct mail. It is critical that you follow
                                            all of the USPS guidelines as you are designing your mail piece. We also
                                            highly recommend that you let our Mail Piece Design Analyst inspect all of
                                            your artwork before you send anything off to be printed. Mail pieces that
                                            are not designed and printed properly usually end up be classified by the
                                            post office as “non-automation compatible” or “ non-machineable”, and
                                            therefore end up having to go at a higher postage rate. There have even been
                                            instances where mail pieces have been determined to be “non-mailable”, and
                                            could not be entered into the post office as bulk mail. As a rule, it’s
                                            always better to be safe than sorry. Don’t print anything until we have a
                                            chance to look at it. It’s as simple as emailing over a PDF proof for us to
                                            look at. Also, we encourage you to check out the “Links” section of our
                                            website. There is a lot of helpful information there from the postal service
                                            about mail piece design.

                                        <p><strong>A:</strong>
                                            Move Update is the term used by the United State Postal Service (USPS) in
                                            regard to updating all mail delivery addresses with National Change of
                                            Address (NCOA) information. The post office now requires that some form of
                                            Move Update process be performed on all mailing lists being used in any kind
                                            of presorted or discounted postage mailings, i.e. bulk mail. In a nutshell,
                                            if you want to do any kind of bulk mailing, you have to make sure that the
                                            people on your mailing list that you are mailing to, still reside at the
                                            delivery addresses you are mailing to. The reason the Post Office has made
                                            this a requirement is because they are trying to reduce the amount of
                                            Undeliverable As Addressed (UAA) mail. In 2006 alone, over 9.7 billion
                                            pieces of mail were sent out with addresses that could not be delivered.
                                            This cost the USPS almost $1.9 billion to process, forward, return, or
                                            destroy.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>There are several factors that lead to a mail piece being undeliverable. One
                                            of the most common reasons is that the mail piece recipient has moved.
                                            Whenever someone fills out a change of address card, or goes to the USPS
                                            Change Of Address web page, a record is generated in the post offices NCOA
                                            master database. By comparing the addresses in your mailing list against
                                            this NCOA master database, we can find the new addresses of those who have
                                            moved, and thereby update your mailing list with the new information.
                                            Electronically updating your mailing list before you mail is the easiest way
                                            to conform to this mandatory USPS requirement. Mailers failing to comply
                                            with the Move Update rules stand to lose their automation discounts. This
                                            would apply to all the pieces in a given mailing, not just those pieces that
                                            couldn’t be delivered. Obviously, any violation would also invite increased
                                            scrutiny of future mailings by the U.S. Postal Service. Here at Better
                                            Letter Mailing Services we have the means to electronically Move Update your
                                            mailing lists prior to each mailing in order to make sure it complies with
                                            the USPS Move Update regulations.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Move Updating your mailing list prior to each mailing is also an excellent
                                            cost saving measure. By cleaning up your mailing list before each mailing,
                                            removing undeliverable addresses, removing duplicates, and removing bad
                                            addresses, you will ultimately have to send out fewer pieces of mail. Why
                                            keep paying over and over again to send out mail that is undeliverable? Not
                                            only will Move Updating your database save you money on the overall cost of
                                            each mailing, but it will also allow your mail to be delivered directly to
                                            your target audience more quickly and accurately. This can dramatically
                                            improve your response rates.

                                        <h3>Q: What is the difference between Presorted Standard mail and Presorted
                                            First Class mail?</h3>
                                        <p><strong>A:</strong>
                                            The postage due for Presorted Standard mail is less than the postage due for
                                            Presorted First Class mail. This is because the level of service provided by
                                            the post office is different between the two classes. For instance,
                                            Presorted Standard mail does not get forwarding or return service. If the
                                            mail piece is Undeliverable as Addressed (UAA), it is disposed of by the
                                            post office. Also, Standard mail primarily travels by ground on trucks,
                                            which can slow down delivery time, whereas Presorted First Class mail gets
                                            quicker delivery service, and even travels via airplane when required.
                                            Presorted First Class mail also gets forwarding and return service.

                                        <h3>Q: Can I send correspondence mail at the Standard mail or Non-profit mail
                                            postage rates?</h3>
                                        <p><strong>A:</strong>
                                            No. Any mail that has personal information in it particular to the person
                                            you are mailing it to, i.e. social security numbers, billing amounts, etc…
                                            cannot travel at the Standard mail or Non-Profit mail postage rates. For
                                            instance, a church cannot send out their end-of-year statements-of-giving at
                                            the Non-profit postage rates. This is because this mail bears personal
                                            information, and therefore must be sent via First Class mail.
                                        </p>
