                                    <p>Postcards aren’t simply a traditional direct mail option; they’re an affordable
                                        marketing solution that allows businesses and organizations to convey essential
                                        information on a medium that is not likely to be overlooked. Postcards remain an
                                        effective direct marketing tool that can support your marketing campaign. If you
                                        are
                                        planning a direct mail campaign using postcards, be sure to keep the following
                                        tips
                                        in mind.</p>

                                        <h3>Use Eye-Catching Imagery </h3>
                                        <p>Boring images and an abundance of text aren’t likely to be very eye-catching
                                            when it comes to your postcard design. Instead, employ a glossy photo or
                                            bold images that will garner attention.</p>
                                        <h3>Use Both Sides </h3>
                                        <p>Using both sides of the postcard should be a no-brainer. Even if you are only
                                            sending a very basic message (Summer Sale), be sure to include relevant
                                            information like store hours or product lists in order to use up the space
                                            effectively.</p>
                                        <h3>Create an Actionable Message</h3>
                                        <p>Postcards don’t afford a lot of room, so be sure to employ a direct message
                                            that expresses what you want customers to do (i.e. use coupon offer or
                                            attend big sale).</p>
                                        <h3>By Multi-Faceted</h3>
                                        <p>A postcard is a great way to mail a special offer, but it’s also a good tool
                                            for building brand recognition. Be sure to include your business logo to
                                            accompany any special offers.</p>
                                        <h3>Opt for Oversized Postcards</h3>
                                        <p>Although standard-size postcards will be the more affordable option for your
                                            direct mail campaign, an oversize postcard is going to secure more
                                            attention.</p>
                                        <h3>Make It Personable</h3>
                                        <p>If your postcard looks like any other flyer with block print and numbers,
                                            it’s not going to stand out especially well. Create a personable message
                                            that stands out from the other direct mail for your postcard.</p>
                                        <h3>Include Contact Information</h3>
                                        <p>Even if you use small print, don’t forget to include essential contact
                                            information like a phone number, address, and website.</p>
                                        <h3>Make It a Keeper</h3>
                                        <p>If you can turn your postcard into a keepsake or transform it into something
                                            useful enough to pin to the fridge, you’re onto something. Many people will
                                            hang onto postcards with captivating artwork or photography (think about
                                            photographing a local site) or that conveys useful information such as a
                                            list of community resources with contact information.</p>
                                        <p>Use these tips to drive your postcard marketing campaign. The internet
                                            certainly isn’t the only way to reach people; postcards continue to be
                                            effective tools in the hands of savvy marketers today.</p>

                                                <p>There are roughly 42 million teens in the US who spend, on average,
                                                    about
                                                    $4,000 each year. Is your business benefitting from a teen customer
                                                    base? Although well over half of America’s teens are online, only 6%
                                                    are
                                                    emailing each other on a daily basis. Reaching them via email,
                                                    therefore, is not necessarily the best avenue for marketers to take.
                                                    Instead, your business might want to rethink its direct mail

                                                    more effectively reach teens.</p>

                                            buying clothes and
                                            music, they are, today, purchasing more expensive merchandise like mobile
                                            tablets and smart phones.</p>
                                        <h3>Teens and Direct Mail</h3>
                                        <p>Marketers have found that, simply put, teens like getting mail. Direct mail
                                            provides teens with what they love: to be treated as adults. While most of
                                            the direct mail that teens receive is from colleges and universities
                                            attempting to market to them, savvy businesses are also targeting this group
                                            with campaigns designed to tap into teens’ largely disposable income. When
                                            it comes to the teen audience, the novelty of direct mail has not worn off.
                                            Businesses simply need to provide relevant content to teens about
                                            merchandise or upcoming sales.</p>
                                        <h3>Designing a Direct Mail Campaign for Teens</h3>
                                        <p>Studies have shown that teens respond to informative content. A direct mail
                                            campaign should attempt to provide information about products that are
                                            relevant to teens. Providing a teen with an incentive like a buy-one,
                                            get-one free offer is the type of giveaway that teens find hard to resist.
                                            Short, bold headlines with a clear call to action should reach teens.
                                            Imagery is also important to teens, so be sure to choose images that are
                                            likely to appeal to this demographic.</p>
                                        <p>The fact is, direct mail has been shown to be the most effective means to
                                            reach teens, according to a study by the Center for Media Design of Ball
                                            State University. The reason colleges continue to connect with teens via
                                            direct mail is because it works. If it works for them, it might just work
                                            for your business too.</p>

                                                    coupon campaign. Although many customers today are presenting their

                                                    country, many businesses still realize that a paper coupon is just
                                                    as alluring as a digital one–and possibly even more convenient!</p>

                                            coupons to their customer base because they work; they get people inside the

                                        <p>It’s also important to remember that not every store accepts digital coupons
                                            shown on a smartphone screen. They expect customers to print them out. By
                                            giving the customer the coupon from the get go, you don’t have to worry
                                            about whether or not they will take the time to print. In addition, coupons

                                            forgotten about. A paper coupon offers customers tried-and-true convenience
                                            that still resonates with them. All a woman has to do is walk her Joanne

                                        <p>If you want immediate results from your direct mail campaign, make sure your
                                            coupon is time sensitive. Many large companies who use coupons send them
                                            monthly or bi-monthly to subtlety put pressure on customers to visit soon
                                            before their coupon expires. A month is a smart time frame to consider. A
                                            week or two might be pushing things for your customer.</p>
                                        <h3>Make It Worthwhile</h3>
                                        <p>You might think you’re being generous by offering that 10% discount, but is
                                            that really going to drive customers in the way a 40% coupon will? If you
                                            want to ensure that your coupon campaign drives them to your business, give
                                            them a good offer. Buy-one-get-free coupons are popular along with other
                                            types of offers, but if you are going to all the trouble to print coupons
                                            and invest in a direct mail campaign, make sure your coupon has the strength
                                            to convince them to shop with you.</p>
                                        <p>Coupons work as many businesses realize. By mailing them right into the hands
                                            of your customers, you have a great chance for increased business. Use these

                                                    material appears to be resonating with customers. When crafting your
                                                    content, be sure that your sales pitches are supported by plenty of
                                                    relevant information, which is what ultimately might sway customers
                                                    to buy.

                                        <h3>Target Your Audience</h3>
                                        <p>Many marketers already realize that a one-size-fits-all direct mail campaign
                                            isn’t likely to be as effective as a campaign designed for each niche of
                                            your target audience. It’s not surprising, after all, that marketers often
                                            appeal to businesses and residential customers using different materials, so
                                            why not employ that practice for different age demographics? You can use
                                            other factors to determine what materials you mail to the specific niches
                                            within your customer base.</p>
                                        <h3>Personalize</h3>
                                        <p>Investing in data that allows you to personalize your direct mail campaign is
                                            a major trend going forward this year. Personalized marketing is already
                                            proving its worth online, but businesses that are applying similar
                                            personalization in their direct mail campaigns are witnessing increased
                                            response rates. If you already go through the trouble of targeting your
                                            audience, take that extra step by personalizing the material you send them.
                                            By including their name and even past purchases if you have that
                                            information, you can speak to them more directly to elicit a better response
                                            rate yourself.</p>
                                        <h3>Basic Design</h3>
                                        <p>What busy homeowner wants to read an essay about why they should buy your
                                            product? Too much text or too complicated a design and your marketing
                                            material is destined for the trash before it’s thoroughly examined. More
                                            than ever, marketers need to create basic messages with simple designs to
                                            appeal to customers who are sorting their mail. Keep sales pitches and
                                            informational content basic and streamlined to entice people to read.</p>
                                        <p>Keep these trends in mind when designing your next direct mail campaign.
                                            Direct mail continues to be an important marketing platform. You can make
                                            the most of your investment in this platform by employing some of the best
                                            marketing practices relied upon today.</p>

                                                <p>While Great Britain may be a long way from your Atlanta-based
                                                    business, it’s still possible to learn much surrounding the benefits
                                                    of direct mail. To determine marketing mail’s efficacy, Great
                                                    Britain’s Royal Mail MarketReach organization embarked on an
                                                    18-month research study before releasing their report, titled “The
                                                    Private Life of Mail.”</p>

                                                <p>The study revealed that the tangible presence and handling of
                                                    physical mail enhanced a recipient’s memory and sensory experience.
                                                    The researchers also found that direct mail has staying power in the
                                                    households studied. For example, advertising mail is kept in a
                                                    household for 17 days on average. The study also found that at least
                                                    39 percent of households studied had a dedicated display area for
                                                    their mail. This means that direct marketing mail items are staying
                                                    present and noticeable in a household.

                                        <p>The RoyalMail report also revealed that people still highly value the mail
                                            and feel valued as customers when they receive tangible mail. These findings
                                            were especially true for a younger subset, a grouping that many advertisers

                                            three-fourths of those polled who were ages 18 to 24 said they look forward
                                            to finding out what’s in their mail on a daily basis. For all ages polled,
                                            65 percent said they anticipate seeing what’s in their mail.</p>
                                        <p>When asked to reflect upon their mail and how it affects the, 57 percent of
                                            people said that receiving mail makes them feel valued. Nearly one-fourth of
                                            those polled said they value an item they can see and touch more highly than
                                            something they can only see.</p>
                                        <h3>Opening and Interacting</h3>
                                        <p>Not only did the study ask people how they felt about their mail, researchers
                                            also asked how people use their mail. This information is intended to guide
                                            direct mail marketers, including those who are Atlanta-based, into the types
                                            of marketing people respond to most. For example, 71 percent of mail
                                            recipients are likely to open a brochure from a company they’ve ordered from
                                            before. This compares to 54 percent who are likely to open a brochure from a
                                            company they have not heard from before.</p>
                                        <p>An estimated 69 percent of respondents were more likely to open a letter
                                            regarding a promotion or special offer while 55 percent of those who opened
                                            the letter were likely to interact with it. The next-most likely direct mail
                                            piece to open was a letter about a product or service an individual does not
                                            currently have, coming in at 60 percent of recipients.</p>
                                        <p>Another aspect of the study focused on people’s attitudes toward two popular
                                            mail options: direct mail and e-mail. An estimated 63 percent of respondents
                                            said they are more likely to take direct mail seriously than when compared
                                            with e-mail. When asked which communications method gives the user a better
                                            impression of the company, 55 percent of respondents reported that mail gave
                                            them a better impression than when compared with e-mail.</p>
                                        <p>Even “across the pond,” research has shown there are many benefits to opting
                                            for direct mail marketing.</p>

                                                    company that’s feeling an outside-the-box approach.</p>

                                                <p>The initial objections to going beyond the standard direct mail
                                                    postcard or other mailer (which definitely still have their place in
                                                    the Atlanta direct mail marketing world) are often concerns about
                                                    costs and then on return on investment (ROI).

                                            The cautious direct mail marketer should take these facts into account,
                                            however, that were revealed in a February 2015 article from the Advertising
                                            Specialty Institute: One, that people prefer to receive direct mail over any
                                            other advertising medium and two, that direct mail costs per lead are
                                            roughly the same as e-mail and pay-per-click advertising.</p>
                                        <h3>Fun With Folds</h3>
                                        <p>Folding a direct mail piece in an intricate and eye-catching manner is one
                                            way companies call attention to their direct mailers. One company utilized a
                                            uniquely folded annual report that could be opened up from different aspects
                                            to review the company’s growth and projections for the year.</p>
                                        <p>From accordion-style to origami-like folding, there are many techniques
                                            businesses can utilize to make folds work for them.</p>
                                        <h3>Activity Mailers</h3>
                                        <p>Sometimes giving a recipient a creative task to complete can more fully draw
                                            him or her into an advertiser’s mailer. One example is a mailer that is an
                                            envelope whose contents include a baggie full of puzzle pieces. When the
                                            puzzle is assembled, the recipient can read the advertiser’s message.</p>
                                        <p>Another advertiser sent along a mailer envelope with a seemingly blank poster
                                            inside and a carbon-copy-like sheet material on the opposite side. When the
                                            user ran his or her hands up and down the poster, imprinted words appeared,
                                            reading “The Future Belongs to The Few Of Us Still Willing to Get Our Hands
                                            Dirty.” When directed to the right customer, this makes for pretty powerful
                                            messaging.</p>
                                        <p>Sending along stickers or even flipbooks are two additional activity-driven
                                            mailers. Some advertisers also send along a pair of 3-D glasses the
                                            recipient has to put on in order to see the message contained within the
                                            mailer.</p>
                                        <h3>Gift-Giving Galore</h3>
                                        <p>While companies may not wish to spend their precious advertising dollars on
                                            an unknown customer or new lead, they may want to retain a customer using a
                                            gift, giving strategy. One company sent its clients Christmas-Teas, a pop-up
                                            box that appeared to have small Christmas trees sticking out of it. When the
                                            recipient lifts up the box, it is revealed that the Christmas trees are
                                            actually Christmas teas or tea bags.</p>
                                        <p>Another gift-like direct mailer is a magnifying glass the user can continue
                                            to use, but that also enlarges the advertiser’s mini-message for easier
                                            reading.</p>
                                        <p>Additional useful items can include matchbooks and even the standard coffee
                                            mug. Each of these gifts has lasting advertising capacity because ideally
                                            the recipient will keep the item and show it off to co-workers or family for
                                            some time to come.</p>

                                                <p>Data from the research company Competiscan found that direct mail has
                                                    shown increases in custom acquisition rates, particularly within the
                                                    financial services sector.</p>

                                                <p>The millennial generation represents those born between the years
                                                    1980 and 1999. They currently represent consumers in a highly sought

                                                    This news may come as a surprise to some Atlanta advertisers, as the
                                                    millennial generation is often considered one that prefers to
                                                    communicate or view advertisements via e-mail and on the computer
                                                    only.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The study found that companies in the financial services sector, such
                                                    as banks, credit card companies and investment firms, are also
                                                    increasing the amount of direct mail sent to millenials. In 2014,
                                                    financial service businesses sent an estimated 10 percent more

                                        <h3>Not Just Business as Usual</h3>
                                        <p>One of the reasons why the financial sector is increasingly utilizing direct
                                            mail marketing efforts is they have found ways to integrate e-mail and
                                            online marketing campaigns more seamlessly with direct mail marketing
                                            opportunities. The messages are also directed at an audience that may not
                                            download an app, but instead prefers to conduct their financial business in
                                            a face-to-face environment. For example, many advertisers opt to give
                                            clients a unique computer link to information about a particular special
                                            offer. This allows the advertiser to track just how many customers are
                                            paying attention to the mailer and acting on it.</p>
                                        <p>Other companies use direct mail to highlight all of the different ways a
                                            person can complete a credit card application. This includes via phone,
                                            smartphone or in person to apply for a credit card.</p>
                                        <p>Direct mail serves as the key that unlocks the door to a potential customer
                                            acquisition. The direct mail advertisement introduces a particular theme,
                                            product or development, then gives the recipient the opportunity to explore
                                            other more common and comfortable methods of communication, such as e-mail.
                                            Even if a recipient does not make immediate use of a particular offer, they
                                            have started to familiarize themselves with a company’s branding and
                                            product. The next time they see this logo or offer, they are more likely to
                                            recall the company and its purpose. </p>
                                        <h3>A Generation of Influence</h3>
                                        <p>Millenials’ and advertisers’ utilization of direct mail has shown that
                                            sometimes the oldest methods of advertising remain the best. Even for a
                                            technology-friendly generation, direct mail still has power and usefulness
                                            in getting media messages through.</p>
                                        <p>Millenials also have a relationship to direct mail that they may not feel
                                            with e-mails or digital advertising communications. Millenials find direct
                                            mail to be more reliable and less intrusive than an e-mail clogging their
                                            inbox. According to a 2012 study from the research firm ExactTarget, people
                                            of all ages said that direct mail does not seem as improper as a cold call

                                                <p>If you have approached your 2015 direct mail marketing strategy the
                                                    same way you did 2014, 2013 and beyond, it’s time to think
                                                    differently. Here are four new strategies to take in 2015 that will
                                                    greatly benefit your direct mail marketing campaigns — and your
                                                    profits. </p>
                                                <h3>1. Segment Your Messages by Researching Your Customers</h3>
                                                <p>If you were speaking directly to a repeat customer and a new
                                                    customer, you would likely use different messages for each. One
                                                    needs education about your business to gain their interest while the
                                                    other needs to know what’s new or innovative they can take advantage
                                                    of. You have to view your direct-mail marketing approaches the same
                                                    way. This begins with how you make and manage your list.</p>

                                        <p>For 2015, improve your messages by dividing your list into three segments:
                                            current, past and future customers. You must then direct your mail messages
                                            accordingly.</p>

                                        <h3>2. Integrate Your Marketing Messages</h3>
                                        <p>When it comes to direct mail, e-mail and other advertising forms, it’s easy
                                            to take an “us versus them” approach where only one approach will do. The
                                            truth is, that integrating these techniques will strengthen your message
                                            overall. Even if it’s colors, a tagline or a special offer, you can use
                                            direct mail as a multiple-touch opportunity to reinforce or introduce a
                                            message.</p>
                                        <h3>3. Test Your Offers</h3>
                                        <p>While a direct mail coupon or special offer may seem compelling to you, how
                                            do you know the direct mail is compelling to your audience? The answer is
                                            that you ask them. This principle can easily tie back in with the
                                            integration concept. Perhaps you launch your e-mail campaign first. You can
                                            come back a few days later and poll your subscribers on if they received
                                            your first message and how they may have responded to it. Or you can simply
                                            use click-through’s and purchasing responses to help gauge its efficacy.</p>
                                        <p>Now you have information at your fingertips. If the message was effective,
                                            great. You can continue your direct mail campaign. If not, consider
                                            re-tooling your messaging. Perhaps you can make it more focused on a certain
                                            segment or consider a slightly different offer that has proven effective in
                                            the past. Another approach is to move up your call to action or make it more
                                            prominent in a direct-mail piece. Learning from your audience and using them
                                            to guide your direct mail is much more likely to equal success.</p>
                                        <h3>4. Take a Good Assessment of Your Direct Mail</h3>
                                        <p>Direct mail is an investment — do your mailers reflect this? One of the worst
                                            things an advertiser can do is send out a piece of direct mail that looks
                                            inexpensive or cheap. While your goal may be to save your customers money,
                                            scrimping on the advertisement that will get them in the door is not the way
                                            to accomplish this. There are many ways to create a stand-out direct mail
                                            piece that makes an impression — and just as many ways not to. Evaluate your
                                            approach and consider other options available to you, such as switching up a
                                            postcard for a direct mail package with a letter.</p>

                                                <p>Without a clear call to action, your direct mail campaign is unlikely
                                                    to be successful. You must explain to recipients what they are
                                                    expected to do if they are interested in your product or service.
                                                    They may have to telephone to make an appointment, access your
                                                    website, or visit your store. No matter what you want them to do,
                                                    you must be sure to be explicit in your direct mail advertisement.

                                                <p>You know what steps you want your audience to take after reading your
                                                    advertisement, so don’t be coy about asking them to take action. It
                                                    is not enough simply to list your website address or telephone
                                                    number in the communication. That will do little more than raise
                                                    brand awareness. If you want to generate new business, you must
                                                    clearly state the steps that your prospective customers must take

                                        <p>Ideally, you want your prospective customers to act immediately on reading
                                            your advertisement. The longer they wait, the less likely they are to call
                                            you, visit your website or come to your store. You can create a sense of
                                            urgency in your call to action by asking recipients to “call today.”
                                            Alternatively, you can include an offer or discount that has to be redeemed
                                            within a specific timeframe.</p>
                                        <h3>The Ideal Location</h3>
                                        <p>You can include a call to action at several points in your direct mail. It
                                            can be stated in the opening or closing paragraphs of your letter, as a P.S.
                                            at the end of the communication, in a highlighted box inserted beside the
                                            main body of text, or in bold text in the body of the letter. You should
                                            take some time to consider which locations will work best in the context of
                                            your advertising copy.</p>
                                        <h3>State Your Call to Action Often</h3>
                                        <p>You may want to include several calls to action in different locations. In
                                            reality, few recipients will read the entire communication. Including a call
                                            to action at the beginning of the communication can be vital to attract the
                                            attention of prospective customers who merely glance at the first few
                                            paragraphs. Including a call to action at the end can be useful as customers
                                            may skip there to find out what to do if they are interested in your offer.

                                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                        <p>Having a clearly stated call to action will increase the response rate from
                                            your direct mail campaign. It is worth spending time crafting an explicit,
                                            unambiguous call to action to ensure that customers know what is expected of
                                            them and are compelled to take action.</p>

                                            and managing direct mail campaigns, Better Letter meticulously ensures that

                                        <h3>ON TIME, EVERY TIME:</h3>
                                        <p>Better Letter knows that every direct mail campaign is time sensitive.
                                            Whether or not the mail piece is promoting a special dated event or has an
                                            expiration date on the offer, it is still imperative that the mail piece hit
                                            at the correct time. Therefore every mail processing job is “Priority One:
                                            Mission Critical” as soon as it hits the production floor. Better Letter is
                                            known throughout the Atlanta business community for getting all of their
                                            direct mail marketing jobs done quickly, and done on-time… every time.
                                            Timeliness is always critical in the direct mail industry. No one knows this
                                            better than Better Letter.</p>

                                            JOBS. Also, if you started processing a direct mail campaign at another mail
                                            house and the job has gotten messed up and behind schedule, give Better
                                            Letter a call. They can usually take mail jobs that have been derailed
                                            somewhere else and fix them so that they can now be entered into the U.S.

                                            the USPS standard mail preparation requirements.</p>
                                        <h3>MAXIMUM POSTAGE DISCOUNTS:</h3>
                                        <p>Better Letter’s CASS Certified and PAVE Certified software systems and their

                                        <h3>In-HOUSE MAIL PIECE DESIGN ANALYST:</h3>
                                        <p>There are many advantages to letting Better Letter handle all of your graphic
                                            and printing services, in addition to handling your mailing services. The
                                            biggest advantage this gives you is that we have a full-time mail piece
                                            design analyst on staff in our graphic arts department. He can make sure
                                            that all of your mail pieces are designed and printed to meet all of the
                                            mail piece design criteria imposed by the U.S. Postal Service. Because we
                                            are a mailing service, many of our customers send us mailing projects that
                                            have been printed elsewhere. We are happy to process all of your mailing
                                            projects, regardless of where they were printed. However, sometimes those
                                            mail pieces show up unexpectedly on our dock, and once we inspect them it is
                                            clear to see that they violate one of more of the U.S. Postal Service’s Bulk
                                            Mail acceptance criteria. When that happens, the customer usually ends up
                                            having to pay more in postage. When your mail piece is not designed and
                                            printed properly, it may not qualify for the lower discounted rates, or
                                            worse yet, it may be deemed “un-mailable” and have to be reprinted. If we
                                            design and print your mail piece, then you know it will be correct every
                                            time.</p>
